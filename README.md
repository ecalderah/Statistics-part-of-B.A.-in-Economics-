## TL;DR
This repository is **my public playground**: a living collection of production-ready notebooks, security scripts, and econometric war machines. Most folders showcase coursework from the Universidad de Guanajuato; the rest are weekend passion projects in **econometric analysis, machine-learning pipelines, AI research, and the occasional late-night exploit**.

> **Development Environment:**  
> - All R analysis was conducted entirely in RStudio.  
> - Python code can be executed in any interface (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, PyCharm, command line, etc.).
